# Cardiovascular Disease data analysis
I looked into the CVD data, carried out data cleaning and exploration using SQL. This project was aimed at finding out the changes in CVD deaths over time, and in different countries. It also aims to find the risk factors that lead to CVD deaths, and any correlation in GDP per capita of countries to CVD deaths rate per 100K?

These are the big questions we are answering here.

The data is available on [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org)


I have also written out the project summary in a [Medium post](https://medium.com/@okwuonugodspeed/cardiovascular-disease-a-big-killer-44b1ffdaf11c)
